# Text-Summarizer

This code takes a paragraph as the input and produces one line summary from that paragraph. I have used text-rank algorithm.<br />


The code will first ask for the file name from where it should read the paragraph, it will then give the one line summary as output.<br />
A sample text file(ab.txt) has been uploaded.<br />
Below image displays the result obtained from ab.txt file: <br />
